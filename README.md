In this project used for corona pandemic situation An Arduino-based automatic soap dispenser using an 
Arduino Nano board, L293D motor driver, ultrasonic sensor, and a motor can be designed to provide a 
touchless and efficient way of dispensing soap. Here's a basic explanation of how the components work 
together:
1. Arduino Nano Board:
The Arduino Nano is a compact microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P chip. It serves as the 
brain of the system, responsible for processing the input from the ultrasonic sensor and controlling the 
motor through the L293D driver.
2. L293D Motor Driver:
 - The L293D is a popular motor driver IC that allows the control of DC motors. It's commonly used in 
robotic applications. In this case, it can control the motor responsible for dispensing soap. The L293D 
can control two motors bidirectionally, making it suitable for controlling the dispensing mechanism.
3. Ultrasonic Sensor:
 - An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the presence of hands or any object within a certain range. It 
works by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after 
hitting an object. The Arduino can then calculate the distance based on the time of flight.
4. Motor:
 - The motor is responsible for dispensing soap. It can be a simple DC motor with a mechanism that 
dispenses soap when activated. The L293D motor driver controls the motor's direction and speed based 
on the signals received from the Arduino.
Workflow:
 
• The ultrasonic sensor continuously sends out ultrasonic waves.
• When an object (such as hands) is detected within a specific range, the Arduino receives a signal 
from the ultrasonic sensor.
• The Arduino processes the signal and activates the motor through the L293D driver.
• The motor dispenses soap for a certain duration or until the ultrasonic sensor no longer detects 
the object.
• The system can be designed to prevent continuous dispensing by implementing a delay or a 
sensor reset mechanism.
Coding Considerations:
 
• The Arduino code should include logic to read the ultrasonic sensor's input and control the 
motor through the L293D driver.
• It may include features such as a delay to prevent continuous dispensing and a mechanism to 
reset the system after each dispensing cycle.
